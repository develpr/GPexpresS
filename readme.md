#Decimal to GPS Coordinate Google Chrome extension#

##Purpose##

When I travel I generally choose to bring a simple GPS device with me to get from place to place. My normal workflow is as follows:

1. Go to Google Maps and search for the location I'm looking for
1. Find the coordinates of the location using whatever technique works for you - as of the time I'm writing this that means I right click on the location on the map and choose "What's here?" which will show the GPS coordinates
1. Copy the GPS coordinates
1. Go to a random website to convert the decimal coordinates to GPS coordinates
1. Done.
